# This repository has a REST API for Product and Analytics entities

This project presents an API Flask Implementation, as requirement for BackEnd Developer position at Osedea Corporation. All details as Business Requirements, Stack Technologies, Solutions Developed and API endpoint presentation and tests are showed below. Thanks for review !

## üìã Business Requirements
A client wants to develop a dashboard to analyze the sales results of their ecommerce website.
Two kinds of users will be able to access to the dashboard: admins and managers. So the client need an API for Product and Statistics information as defined in the User Story below.

* 1 - **Entities details and Funcionability**
  * 1.1 - **Product : Atributes** id:int, name:string, description:string</br>
           * 1.1.1 - Create a new product
           * 1.1.2 - View the full list of products
           * 1.1.3 - Update product information
           * 1.1.4 - Delete a produc
           
  * 1.2 - **Analytics : Atributes** id:int, order_id:int, date:datetime, session_duration:int, nb_products:int, amount:float, new_visitor:string, device_type:string</br>
           * 1.2.1 - Total revenue in 2020</br>
           * 1.2.2 - The average revenue of orders made on a mobile device (smartphone or tablet)</br>
           * 1.2.3 - The average number of products per order</br>
           * 1.2.4 - One route that returns all the statistics
           
* 2 - **Rules**
  * 2.1 - The admins can access to all the statistics
  * 2.2 - The managers can't access to the revenue statistics

* 3 - **Future Need**
  * 3.1 - Create new user roles with different data access in the future
  * 3.2 - New metrics might be available in a next version of the CSV file

## ‚öôÔ∏è Main Technologies
* 1 - **Flask** Endpoint and infraestruture
* 2 - **SQLAlchemy** Database acess and configuration
* 3 - **Blueprint** Integrate different endpoint file

## ‚öôÔ∏è Architecture ( MVC Pattern )
To meet the functional requirements indicated by the customer, all services (endpoint) are available in a single app.py file. This approach does not represent the cohesion and coupling best practices described in Software Engineering. Therefore, some improvement points are described below and will be implemented in next release.
* 1 - **Entities**
    * 1.1 - Create different endpoint file for each entity (Product, Analytics and other)
* 2 - **Models**
    * 2.1 - Create a file for different Entities
* 3 - **Configurations**
    * 3.1 - Create a file for configurations
* 4 - **Utils module** 
    * 4.1 - Create a file for utils functions

## ‚öôÔ∏è The Project Development
  **Developper Feedback**
  Despite working with systems development with a focus on backend for almost 20 years, developing this REST API using Python, Flask and SQLAlchemy was an extra challenge, as they are technologies with which I had no practical experience until the moment I started the implementation of the API.</br>

In the 4 days of deadline I had to research, learn and implement the entire project. Some tutorials on youtube gave me the minimum knowledge necessary to start coding and prepare my "Hello World", which gradually grew to meet the customer's needs.</br>

I recognize that the project has Software Engineering flaws and that it also need applying advanced concepts of the technologies used, but that's for a next release.</br>

**1 - How the problem was approached** Step by step, and the first point was to try to understand how technologies are used in their simplest forms. From this central idea, all the features were developed in the simplest way and without architectural concerns.</br>

**2 - Explain your reasoning behind any technical decisions you made** As an experienced developer, I know the importance of a good MVC development model, but the approach to project development was to focus on learning, coding and meeting the business requirements first, and then improving other technical aspects with the creation of modules of business and blueprint integration

**3 - Best practices or changes you would make if this were a real production app**
    * 1.1 - Token generation dynamically and valid for a few minutes
    * 1.2 - Not use email as user name
    * 1.3 - Create a Analytics.csv table for importing control, avoinding import the same file twice
    * 1.4 - Create Project Test using framework Rest-Assured for API Test
    * 1.5 - Create a hook from GitLab and Jenkins, SonarQube, Quality Gate for CD/CI Environment pipeline
    * 1.6 - Use the SGBD like MySQL, PortGres
    * 1.7 - Create different layer project 
      ** 1.7.1 - Controller (endpoint)
      ** 1.7.2 - Data Transfer Object DTO/VO
      ** 1.7.3 - Business Object BO
      ** 1.7.4 - DAO
    * 1.8 - Load Balance and Backup
    * 1.9 - Create a LOG funcionallity
    * 1.10 - Data importing functionality by assincronous methodology
     
**4 - Any learning resources used**
    * 4.1 - Youtube
    * 4.2 - Blogs and tutorials
    * 4.3 - Official documentation (Flask, SQLALchemy)

**5 - if some steps were not completed, the steps you would have taken in your approach to complete them**
    * 5.1 - Dockerization was not completed. Actions: Improve knowledge about Decker
    * 5.2 - User authentication was not completed until today (04/21). I'll try complete it in 04/22 

**6 - Any major issues encountered and the solutions found (or not)**
    * 6.1 - Date format in Analytics.py file was not valid for database. Was created a function to convert in valid date
    * 6.2 - New visitor in Analytic.py file is string while the Entity is Boolean. Was created a function that read the value as 'Yes' or 'No' and setting 0 or 1

## ‚öôÔ∏è API RESTFul JUnit Test - Running Examples
As requirement, this project implemented JUnit test class for Dealer and Listing Service. Some tests are descrited below.

* 1 - **The Test Classes** 
  * 1.1 - The class **BaseClassAPITest.java** conect with data base using user named leandro and password admin123. After that, receive a token to add in all request. Is not necessary running this class. It will run automatically on each test  
  * 1.2 - The class **DealerEndpointDifferentMethodologiesTest.java** tests the Dealer endpoint using different test methologies.
  * 1.3 - The class **DealerEndpointTest.java** define the RestAssured given(), When() and Then() methologies
  * 1.4 - The class **ListingEndpointTest.java** test different business aspect 
  
* 2 - **Test Classes Path**
  * 2.1 - Path classes in src/test/java/br/com/edfcbz/endpoint/dealer package (Run file as JUnit test)
  * 2.2 - Path classes in src/test/java/br/com/edfcbz/endpoint/listing package (Run file as JUnit test)

* 3 - **Suite Test**
  * 3.1 -  The **Suite360AgenceTest.java** class will run all test classes from project. For this, go to path src/test/java/br/com/edfcbz/endpoint/dealer package (Run file as JUnit test). The final result looks like the image below.</br>

## üìã API Development - Review Technical Aspect and Improvement Suggestions
* **1 ListingServiceBO.java**
   * 1.1 - Method **public Listing update(Listing listing_)**
           *This method need some improvements in logical and structural aspect. Improvements in Dealer's Listing limit test (published)
   * 1.2 - Method **public Listing published(String listingId)**
           *With similar aspect with update methody, it's possible improve the Limit Listing test, creating a new method for test it.
   * 1.3 - Method **public void findDealerByDealerIdAndVerifyNameAndLimitListing()**

* **2 - DealerServiceBO.java**
   * 2.1 - Method **public Dealer update(Dealer _dealer)**
           *This method need improvements during Limit updating. This service not verify the Listing state as published yet ( Known bug )

* **3 - Exception Classes**
   * 3.1 - Generalize and reduce the number of exception classes. It will be important to adopt a handle class that will be responsible for returning the appropriate exception class for each case.

## üìã LOG - Review Technical Aspect and Improvement Suggestions
   * 1.1 - Increase details, adding logged user in the message
   * 1.2 - Currently shown log message on console. Add save-to-file behavior

## üìã JUnit Test - Review Technical Aspect and Improvement Suggestions

**(Functional Test)** Status: Developed
* **1 - ListingEndpointTest.java 
   * 1.1 - Class **DealerEndpointTest.java**
   * 1.2 - Class **ListingEndpointTest,java**
In general, deepen the level of tests especially when the return has complex object with objects and list. Example: the draft or published Listing of a specific dealer

**(Coverage Test)** Status: Technical debt (Not developed)
**(Unit Test)** Status: Technical debt (Not developed)

## üìã DevOps - Review Technical Aspect and Improvement Suggestions
Is essential implement the DevOps concept as below:
* 1 - Continuous Development and Continuous Delivery environment CD/CI using tools such as pipeline Jenkins
* 2 - Quality Gate and Sonar To define the developed code acceptance criteria
* 3 - Dockerized environment, for Development and Homologation

## üìã Technical Debt
As a requirement, the use of the UUID data type was requested as an identifier for the Dealer and Listing entities, however the project used the String type and the **org.hibernate.id.UUIDGenerato** strategy to generate the primary keys.
